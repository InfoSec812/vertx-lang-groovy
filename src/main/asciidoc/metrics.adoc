== Metrics

Vert.x provides a fairly simple API to retrieve metrics via the `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/metrics/Measured.html[Measured]` interface
which is implemented by various Vert.x components like `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/http/HttpServer.html[HttpServer]`, `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/net/NetServer.html[NetServer]`,
and even `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/Vertx.html[Vertx]` itself.

By default Vert.x does not record any metrics. Instead it provides an SPI for others to implement like https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-metrics[vertx-metrics]
which can be added to the classpath. Once added, you can enable metrics by doing the following:
[source,groovy]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.Vertx
def vertx = Vertx.vertx([
  metricsOptions:[
    enabled:true
  ]
])

----

Once enabled, you can retrieve metrics from any `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/metrics/Measured.html[Measured]` object which provides
a map of the metric name to the data, represented by a `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/json/JsonObject.html[JsonObject]`. So for example if we were to print
out all metrics for a particular Vert.x instance:
[source,groovy]
----
def metrics = vertx.metrics()
metrics.each { name, metric ->
  println("${name} : ${metric.toString()}")
}

----

NOTE: For details on the actual contents of the data (the actual metric) represented by the `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/json/JsonObject.html[JsonObject]`
consult the implementation documentation like https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-metrics[vertx-metrics]

Often it is desired that you only want to capture specific metrics for a particular component, like an http server
without having to know the details of the naming scheme of every metric (something which is left to the implementers of the SPI).

Since `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/http/HttpServer.html[HttpServer]` implements `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/metrics/Measured.html[Measured]`, you can easily grab all metrics
that are specific for that particular http server.
[source,groovy]
----
def server = vertx.createHttpServer()
// set up server
def metrics = server.metrics()

=== Metrics SPI

The metrics SPI is an advanced feature which allows implementers to capture events from Vert.x in order to gather metrics. For
more information on this, please consult the `link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/spi/metrics/VertxMetrics.html[API Documentation]`.
