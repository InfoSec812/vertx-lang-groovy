Most data in Vert.x is shuffled around using instances of link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/buffer/Buffer.html[`Buffer`]

A Buffer represents a sequence of zero or more bytes that can be written to or read from, and which expands
automatically as necessary to accomodate any bytes written to it.

You can perhaps think of a buffer as
smart byte array.

=== Creating Buffers

Create a new empty buffer:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer();

----

Create a buffer from a String. The String will be encoded in the buffer using UTF-8.

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer("some-string");

----

Create a buffer from a String: The String will be encoded using the specified encoding, e.g:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer("some-string", "UTF-16");

----

Create a buffer with an initial size hint. If you know your buffer will have a certain amount of data written to
it you can create the buffer and specify this size. This makes the buffer initially allocate that much memory
and is more efficient than the buffer automatically resizing multiple times as data is written to it.

Note that buffers created this way are empty. It does not create a buffer filled with zeros up to the specified size.

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer(100000);

----

=== Writing to a Buffer

There are two ways to write to a buffer: appending, and random access. In either case buffers will always expand
automatically to encompass the bytes. It's not possible to get an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a buffer.

==== Appending to a Buffer

To append to a buffer, you use the `appendXXX` methods. Append methods exist for appending other buffers,
byte arrays, String and all primitive types.

The return value of the `appendXXX methods is the buffer itself, so these can be chained:

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer();
buff.appendInt(123).appendString("hello\n");
socket.write(buff);

----

==== Random access buffer writes

You can also write into the buffer at a specific index, by using the `setXXX` methods. Set methods exist for
other buffers, byte arrays, String and all primitive types. All the set methods take an index as the first
argument - this represents the position in the buffer where to start writing the data.

The buffer will always expand as necessary to accomodate the data.

[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.groovy.core.buffer.Buffer
def buff = Buffer.buffer();
buff.setInt(1000, 123);
buff.setString(0, "hello");

----

=== Reading from a Buffer

Data is read from a buffer using the `getXXX` methods. Get methods exist for byte arrays, String and all primitive types.
The first argument to these methods is an index in the buffer from where to get the data.

[source,java]
----
def buff = getSomeBuffer();
for (def i = 0;i < buff.length();4) {
  println("int value at ${i} is ${buff.getInt(i)}");
};

----

=== Other buffer methods:

* link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/buffer/Buffer.html#length()[`length`]. To obtain the length of the buffer. The length of a buffer is the
  index of the byte in the buffer with the largest index + 1.
* link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/buffer/Buffer.html#copy()[`copy`]. Copy the entire buffer

See the link:groovydoc/io/vertx/groovy/core/buffer/Buffer.html[`doc`] for more detailed method level documentation.
